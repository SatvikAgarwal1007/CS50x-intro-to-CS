# CS50 Week 0 – Foundations of Computer Science

## 📌 Overview
This project marks the beginning of my journey in CS50's Introduction to Computer Science.  
Week 0 focused on the **fundamentals of computational thinking**, algorithms, and how computers represent and process information.  

The week concluded with a hands-on application: building an interactive program in [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) to apply core concepts in a visual, event-driven environment.

## 🎯 Key Concepts Learned
- **Problem Decomposition** – Breaking a large problem into smaller, manageable steps.
- **Algorithms** – Understanding step-by-step instructions, efficiency, and correctness.
- **Data Representation** – Binary, decimal, and ASCII encoding.
- **Abstraction** – Hiding complex details to focus on high-level problem-solving.
- **Event-Driven Programming** – Using events to control flow and interaction.
- **Programming Basics** – Loops, conditionals, variables, and parallel execution.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) (for Week 0 project implementation)

## 🚀 Week 0 Project
**Title:** *Zombie Apocalypse*  
**Description:** A simple game where the player follows the mouse cursor, avoids a chasing zombie, and collects apples to earn points.
